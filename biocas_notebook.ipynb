    "### VCO model as a Python class\n",
    "First, we create a Python class to model the VCO; this is a purely mathematical representation of the VCO. By this, we mean that the VCO is described by variables and parameters that allow us to calculate the activity for a given spatial path, rather than the VCO being an actual unit oscillating in time. In other words, it is represented by a series of shifted sinusoids, instead of a variable-frequency oscillator.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first three functions in the class are used internally to initialize and print an instance of the VCO model. Each VCO has the following parameters that describe it:\n",
    "* N - the number of cells in the VCO\n",
    "* $\\rho$ - the slope of speed modulation (relating to the preferred vector magnitude)\n",
    "* $\\theta$ - the preferred vector orientation\n",
    "* `phz_noise` - a variable controlling the amount of jitter added to the preferred directions of the VCO's cells (we will leave this at 0, meaning that the preferred directions are each $\\frac{2\\pi}{N}$ greater than the previous cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last function, `cell_activity`, allows us to see the activity of the VCO at a given location, for a given cell within the VCO."
